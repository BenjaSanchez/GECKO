* SOAPpy: for this, open command promt as admin, and then type:
    _> cd C:\Python27\Scripts_
    _> easy_install-2.7 SOAPpy_

========================

## Required Software for Matlab module:

* MATLAB (7.5 or higher) + Optimization Toolbox (http://www.mathworks.com/).
* The COBRA toolbox for MATLAB (https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox). Note that libSBML (http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML) and the SBML toolbox (http://sbml.org/Software/SBMLToolbox) should both be installed. Both of them are free of charge for academic users. Aditionally, you should add the cobra folder to your MATLAB search path.
